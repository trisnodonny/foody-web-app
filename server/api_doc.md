Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.",
